/**
 *   
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command currently consists of three strings: a command word and a second
 * word (item or place) and third word(only used where necessary).
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the second word is <null>.
